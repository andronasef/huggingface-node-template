## Steps to Reimplement 

First, you should set up your GitHub repository and Spaces app together. Add your Spaces app as an additional remote to your existing Git repository.
```
git remote add space https://huggingface.co/spaces/HF_USERNAME/SPACE_NAME
```
Then force push to sync everything for the first time:
```
git push --force space main
```
